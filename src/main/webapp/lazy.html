	    That's not a lot of markup code.  Just mark the
	    block of markup that's going to take a long time to 
	    calculate.  Lift takes care of the rest.
	    Let's look at the <a href="http://stable.simply.liftweb.net/#sec:Snippets">snippet</a> code:
	  </big>
	</big>
      </div>

      <pre class="lift:ShowCode?name=/net/liftweb/seventhings/snippet/LongTime.java;start=**">view code</pre>


      <div>

	    Most other frameworks don't have lazy loading as part of
	    the core framework.  It's generally very hard to do, but
	    because Lift has excellent 
	    <span class="lift:Menu.item?name=comet">comet</span>
	    support, it's easy to "push" content from the
	    server to the browser.
